# Multiply Two Strings of Digits in Go
I didn't know that numbers liked to jump around on me until I started reading back credit card numbers at a job I had post-high school. Gee, guess what hasn't been a problem since the problem was diagnosed? But I was still held back in math in 2ed grade which "left a mark" as they say. So when I got the "Multiply two long strings of numbers together" question on an interview I had years and years ago, I choked.

More recently I wanted to fiddle with Go so I thought why not slay that ole' dragon?

Well. It's dead.
